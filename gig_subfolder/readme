``sh populate.sh`` to gen test files
``bash gig-subfolder.sh`` places any file with zip extension, not containing cpd in the filename and greater than the size variable into its own subfolder
``sh cleanup.sh`` to rm test files

BUG right now the conditional size is not working it puts all zips != *cpd* in subfolders... annoying
also creates a file named according to size variable
